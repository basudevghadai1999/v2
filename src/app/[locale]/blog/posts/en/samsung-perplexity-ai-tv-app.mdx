Samsung Electronics today announced the launch of the Perplexity TV App, the first-ever Perplexity AI-powered TV app on the market. Elevating Samsung's Vision AI Companion, which brings smart, generative AI support to the largest communal screens, the Perplexity TV App offers a new and innovative AI-powered experience to help users quickly find what they're looking for and discover new favorites.

## What is Perplexity?

Perplexity is an AI-powered answer engine that draws from credible sources in real time, accurately answering questions, performing deep research, and suggesting additional questions that allow curious users to engage more deeply with the content they consume.

"The first-of-its-kind Perplexity AI-powered app, now available only on Samsung TVs, broadens our Vision AI Platform offering for a more unique and personalized user experience," said Dan Glassman, Senior Director & Head of New Business Development for Samsung Electronics. "Samsung continually brings innovative and first-to-market experiences to our device owners, and this partnership with Perplexity is the latest that will deliver cutting-edge AI technology, redefining how Samsung owners interact with their TVs."

## Elevating the Vision AI Companion Experience

Unveiled earlier this month at IFA 2025, the Vision AI Companion brings the next evolution of AI-powered displays to Samsung TVs and smart monitors by integrating Samsung's most advanced AI features into a single, intuitive AI experience. As part of the Vision AI Companion, the Perplexity TV App is now available as a standalone AI agent, offering even more innovative AI-powered experiences to Samsung users.

Navigate to the Perplexity TV App on your TV's home screen and click on it to launch. From there, Perplexity can help with:
- Planning a trip
- Finding which movies were directed by the Russo Brothers
- Creating the ultimate fantasy lineup
- And much more, all directly from your TV

## Getting Started

The Perplexity TV App offers a sleek and visually appealing experience, going beyond text-only responses. When you ask Perplexity a question, results appear with high-quality, glanceable cards made just for Samsung TVs.

### How It Works:

1. **Access**: Navigate to the Perplexity TV App via the Apps Tab or in Samsung's Vision AI Companion, accessible via the AI Button.

2. **Activation**: Users must accept the terms and conditions and allow Perplexity to access their microphones before using the AI voice component.

3. **(Optional)**: For those who don't want to use voice commands, the onscreen keyboard or USB keyboard can be used to search with the Perplexity TV App.

4. **Ask for anything**: Whether you want recommendations for Halloween entertainment or help with an everyday task, Perplexity knows the answer.

## Partnership Vision

"Curiosity can strike at any time. Perplexity's mission is to serve the world's curiosity by bridging the gap between traditional search and innovative AI-driven interfaces," said Ryan Foutty, VP of Business at Perplexity. "Samsung is the number one television brand in the world, and we are excited to bring the functionality that Perplexity users know and trust to Samsung's television screens and device owners around the world."

## Availability

The Perplexity TV App is now available on all 2025 Samsung TVs and will be available on 2023 and 2024 TVs with the latest OS upgrade later this year. 

As a bonus, Perplexity is offering a **free 12-month subscription to Perplexity Pro** for all users. Simply scan the QR code on the Perplexity TV app to redeem.

## The Future of AI-Powered Entertainment

This partnership represents a significant step forward in how we interact with our entertainment systems. By bringing AI-powered search and discovery directly to the TV screen, Samsung and Perplexity are making it easier than ever to find content, get answers, and explore new interestsâ€”all from the comfort of your couch.

The integration of AI into everyday devices like TVs demonstrates the growing importance of intelligent assistants in our daily lives, and Samsung's Vision AI Companion is leading the way in making these experiences seamless and intuitive.
