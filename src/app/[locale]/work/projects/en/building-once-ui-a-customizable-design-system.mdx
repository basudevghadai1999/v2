## Overview

Developed a comprehensive cloud-native platform that leverages AI and automation to streamline business processes, featuring intelligent workflow orchestration, real-time analytics, and seamless integration with enterprise systems.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Workflow Engine**: Built an intelligent automation system using LangGraph and FastAPI that orchestrates complex multi-step workflows with adaptive decision-making capabilities.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Designed and implemented a scalable microservices architecture with Docker containerization, enabling independent deployment and horizontal scaling across AWS infrastructure.
- **Real-Time Processing Pipeline**: Developed high-throughput data processing pipelines using AWS Lambda, SQS, and Kinesis for handling millions of events per day with sub-second latency.
- **LLM Integration**: Integrated multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, AWS Bedrock) with intelligent routing and fallback mechanisms, ensuring 99.9% uptime and optimal cost efficiency.
- **Vector Database Implementation**: Implemented semantic search and retrieval using Pinecone and Weaviate, enabling context-aware AI responses and intelligent document processing.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, Django, Flask
- **AI/ML**: LangGraph, LangChain, OpenAI APIs, AWS Bedrock
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: AWS (ECS, Lambda, S3, RDS, ElastiCache), GCP (Vertex AI)
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Pinecone, Weaviate
- **DevOps**: Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD with GitHub Actions, Terraform

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the biggest challenges was maintaining consistent performance while scaling to handle enterprise-level traffic. The solution involved implementing intelligent caching strategies with Redis, optimizing database queries, and leveraging AWS auto-scaling groups. Additionally, managing LLM costs while maintaining quality required developing a sophisticated prompt caching and response optimization system that reduced API costs by 60%.

Another key learning was designing for resilience - implementing circuit breakers, retry mechanisms, and graceful degradation ensured the platform maintained high availability even during partial service outages.

## Outcome

The platform now serves multiple enterprise clients, processing over 5 million automated workflows monthly with 99.95% uptime. It has reduced manual processing time by 85%, improved decision accuracy by 40%, and generated significant cost savings through intelligent automation. The modular architecture has enabled rapid feature development, with new AI capabilities being deployed weekly without disrupting existing services.
