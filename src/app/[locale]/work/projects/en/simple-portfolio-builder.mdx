## Overview

Developed a comprehensive multi-agent AI system using LangGraph and FastAPI, enabling intelligent task orchestration and semantic memory management across distributed cloud infrastructure.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Built a modular framework using LangGraph for coordinating multiple LLM agents with specialized roles and capabilities.
- **Semantic Memory System**: Implemented vector database integration (Pinecone/Weaviate) for persistent context and intelligent information retrieval.
- **Cloud-Native Architecture**: Deployed on AWS (ECS, App Runner) and GCP (Vertex AI) with auto-scaling and high availability.
- **API-Driven Reasoning**: Created RESTful APIs with FastAPI for real-time agent communication and decision-making workflows.

## Technologies Used

- **FastAPI**: High-performance async API framework for agent communication
- **LangGraph**: Multi-agent orchestration and workflow management
- **AWS/GCP**: Cloud deployment with Elastic Beanstalk, ECS, and Vertex AI
- **Vector Databases**: Pinecone and Weaviate for semantic search and memory
- **OpenAI/Bedrock**: LLM integration for intelligent reasoning

## Challenges and Learnings

Managing state consistency across distributed agents was a key challenge. The solution involved implementing a centralized semantic memory layer with vector embeddings, enabling agents to share context efficiently. Additionally, optimizing API latency while maintaining reasoning quality required careful prompt engineering and caching strategies.

## Outcome

The system successfully handles complex multi-step tasks with improved accuracy and reduced latency. It's now processing thousands of requests daily, demonstrating the scalability and reliability of the architecture.
